# stateful_books

A fork of the Books example of [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router), that uses stateful nested navigation, 
i.e. `StatefulShellRoute` for the main navigation shell. Currently this sample requires the 
[PR #2650](https://github.com/flutter/packages/pull/2650) 
(or [https://github.com/tolo/flutter_packages/tree/nested-persistent-navigation](https://github.com/tolo/flutter_packages/tree/nested-persistent-navigation)).


# serverpod branch
For an implementation using [Serverpod](https://serverpod.dev) as a backend, see the [serverpod branch](https://github.com/tolo/stateful_books/tree/serverpod).
